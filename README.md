Short courses on algorithms : practical recommendations to build solid, energy efficient and maintainable programs

Those lessons are addressed to the "Développeur Informatique Multisupports" (DIM) Bachelor proposed at Université Savoie Mont Blanc in France.
Students are expected to be familiar with programming. The aim is to get more familiar with code quality, maintainability and efficacy.

**Lessons organisation draft :**

1. Get familiar with maintainable codes using git, sonarcloud and doxygen. *Introduction* slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xXrdokfxOUP-3b1fEPRfieUhOEez7FJeUtauMpjV4bk/edit?usp=sharing)

2. Get familiar with unit testing and continuous integration using pytest and TravisCI. *Introduction* slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wb93gyr6JuIDfeDvqTkMBxoLulL_yOXDeYp9qR5EaFI/edit?usp=sharing)

3. Get sensible to performance concerns. Hand crafted codes vs libraries

4. Get familiar with queues using RabbitMQ and CloudAMQP. *Introduction slides* [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e-KtztT1KN91ynFhzSfDrdF8qvuYPadKe04ifyxtvrg/edit?usp=sharing)

Evaluation will consist of continuous control and a final exam. A preliminary test is planned in the first session to check student entry levels.
